On this activity, we explore the use of MongoDB for storage as well as pracitces using the IndexDB.  We were provided a Develop folder which contained a public folder which had html and js files for view and functionality, in addition, we were provided a seeds folder. On the project we needed to build our api routes, server.js for connections, and a models folder for the schemas to build the DB.
